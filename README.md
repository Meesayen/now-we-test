Temporary lib to help test [Now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) lambdas written in Node.js. It was created with the purpose to eventually be deprecated when [`now dev` command](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/1681) is released.

## Purpose

Help unit test and locally serve lambdas written to deploy using Now.

## Installation

`yarn add now-we-test --dev`

## Usage

### For unit tests

In your unit tests, you can use the `lambda` help to simulate a lambda execution environment without needing a running server:

```js
import { lambda } from 'now-we-test'
import func from '../your-lambda-implementation'

const app = lambda(func)

describe('func', () => {
  it('should do something', async () => {
    const result = await app.get('/')

    expect(result.text).toBe('[the value returned by the lambda]')
  })
})
```

> The result of the invokation of `lambda` helper is a [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) instance, so please refer to that documentation for details on possible assertions and usage.

### For locally serving lambdas

_Now we test_ provides a simple CLI to serve your lambdas locally - useful for testing integration with other tools.

> Keep in mind there is only so much it can do in terms of simulation, so you should never completelly trust what works locally would necessarily work on Now.sh environment.

#### Commands

- [`now-we-test serve`](#now-we-test-serve)
- [`now-we-test help [COMMAND]`](#now-we-test-help-command)

##### `now-we-test serve`
